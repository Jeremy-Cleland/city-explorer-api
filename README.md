**Author**: Jeremy Cleland
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview

As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see the exact latitude and longitude of that location.

As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.

As a user, I want to see a map of the city so that I can see the layout of the area I want to explore.
